The aim of my project was to explore the challenges posed by imbalanced data in machine learning and investigate various techniques for dealing with this issue. Specifically, I focused on preparing imbalanced data for machine learning and implementing best practices for developing effective models.

In order to accomplish these goals, I experimented with several different machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), and gradient boosting (GB) methods. I also tested various data preparation techniques, such as undersampling, oversampling, and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE).

One key feature of my project was that I did not rely on grid search to identify the best hyperparameters for my models. Instead, I examined the effects of parameter changes on my models through graphical examples. By visualizing the performance of my models across different hyperparameter values, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of how my models were impacted by specific tuning choices.

Throughout the course of the project, I also explored a range of best practices for machine learning, including cross-validation, feature selection, and model evaluation metrics. By incorporating these techniques into my workflow, I was able to build more robust and accurate models that could handle the challenges posed by imbalanced data.

Overall, my project provided valuable insights into the challenges of working with imbalanced data and highlighted the importance of careful data preparation and model selection. By implementing best practices and examining the effects of parameter changes through graphical examples, I was able to build effective models that could handle imbalanced data with greater accuracy and reliability.
